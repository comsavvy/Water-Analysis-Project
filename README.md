# Project on water analysis
<p>This analysis is about measuring how water is being used in each location mentioned in the project and how water flow in each tap. </p>

***Water resources*** '`Data`' class was modified to be in a module, where all the `methods` can be called directly instead of being called in **`Jupyter Notebook`**. Help ***`method`*** can be call in the `module` or the `methods` within it e.g `?Data` or `help(Data)` in order to know the available ***`methods`***.
